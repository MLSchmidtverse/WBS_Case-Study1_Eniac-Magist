# WBS_Case-Study1_Eniac-Magist

## Summary
This project simulates a real business scenario for the online marketplace Eniac, which is exploring expansion into the Brazilian market. To overcome its lack of local expertise, Eniac is considering a partnership with Magist, a Brazilian SaaS company. The analysis uses data from 2016-2018 to assess Magist's capabilities in areas such as salesperson performance, customer satisfaction and delivery efficiency. The goal is to determine if Magist can effectively support Eniac's entry into the Brazilian market, particularly in handling high-end Apple products and maintaining high customer satisfaction standards.

## Case Overview
Eniac is an established European online retailer based in Spain and popular across Europe, specializing in high-end Apple-compatible accessories. Facing increasing investor pressure to expand into the Brazilian market, Eniac is considering a 3-year partnership with Magist to manage its order fulfillment and logistics.

### Analysis focus:
- Assessing Magist's ability to handle Eniac's premium product line.
- Evaluating Magist's delivery performance against Eniac's high customer satisfaction standards.
- Analyzing the Brazilian market's potential for Eniac's expansion.

### Specifics per key variable:

- Seller performance: Analyzing sales trends, order fulfillment rates, and return rates.
- Customer satisfaction: Evaluating customer feedback, order cancellations, and overall customer experience.
- Delivery efficiency: Assessing delivery times, on-time delivery rates, and potential delivery bottlenecks.
- Financial impact: Analyzing the potential cost savings and return on investment for Eniac.

This project aims to provide actionable insights and recommendations to Eniac's CEO regarding the potential partnership with Magist. By utilizing data analysis techniques (SQL and Tableau) and market research, the analysis will determine whether a partnership with Magist aligns with Eniac's long-term strategic goals and supports its successful entry into the Brazilian market.
